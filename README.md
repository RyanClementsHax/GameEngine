# GameEngine

This is a follow along repository with [The Cherno's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) which teaches others how to write a game engine from scratch. This will follow along closely with [his repository](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

## Goals
1. Learn graphics
1. Learn cpp development
1. Code in an environment where I have to manage memory
1. BUILD A FREAKING GAME ENGINE :DDD
1. Have fun

## Getting Started
Windows is the only platform currently supported, and Visual Studio 2019 is the only development environment that this is tested in.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/GameEngine.git`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

Then run scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat to generate project/solution files so this can be opened and built in VS2019
