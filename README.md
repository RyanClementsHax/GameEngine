# GameEngine

This is a follow along repository with [The Cherno's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) which teaches others how to write a game engine from scratch. This will follow along closely with [his repository](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

## Goals
1. Learn graphics
1. Learn cpp development
1. Code in an environment where I have to manage memory
1. BUILD A FREAKING GAME ENGINE :DDD
1. Have fun

## Getting Started
1. clone the repository with submodules by running `git clone --recursive https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/GameEngine.git`
    - if the repository was cloned non-recursively, you can clone the submodules after the fact with `git submodule update --init`
1. make sure you have Visual Studio installed with `Desktop Development with C++`
    - Windows is the only platform currently supported, and Visual Studio 2019 is the only development environment that this is tested in.
1. run scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat to generate project/solution files so this can be opened and built in VS2019
1. Run Sandbox or GameEngine-Editor to start work!
